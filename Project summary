Project Introduction: Cryptopunks NFT Sales Analysis
Over the past few years, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized digital asset ownership, with over $22 billion spent on NFTs in a single year. 
These blockchain-based assets gained popularity for their unique value, artistic appeal, and speculative potential. 
However, the NFT market faces controversies due to scams, lack of regulation, and environmental concerns. 
Despite these challenges, the transparent nature of blockchain data presents an exciting opportunity for analysis.

This project involves analyzing the Cryptopunks NFT sales dataset, which spans from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. 
Each row represents a sale, detailing key attributes such as buyer and seller addresses, transaction prices in ETH and USD, sale dates, NFT IDs, and transaction hashes.

Sales Insights:
Analyze sales volume and identify top transactions.
Understand day-of-week sales trends and price averages.

Price Analysis:
Determine average prices by NFT name.
Calculate moving averages for transaction prices.
Develop histograms and summaries of ETH price ranges.

Wallet Analysis:
Examine transaction patterns for specific wallets.
Create tailored views, such as tracking purchases for specific buyers.

Performance Metrics:
Identify the most-sold NFTs for each month/year.
Calculate total monthly sales volume.

Estimated Value Analysis:
Exclude outliers and compute a reliable daily average price using advanced filtering and window functions.
